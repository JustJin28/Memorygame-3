# Memory Game Project

This is a very simple version of a Memory Game, as you might have played at some point. There is a 16 card deck consisting of 8 pairs of cards. The game is won if you match all 8 pairs in less than a set number of moves. The three stars on the top right corner represent the current score of the game which will decrease as you make certain amounts of moves.
